## Welcome to the Kitz-Karlton!

Our CLI application works as an employee portal for a fake cat hotel - the Kitz Karlton. Users can interact with the CLI and follow the prompts to manage reservations, cats that stay at the hotel, and their owner data. 

Within the management menus for each table type, users can see, create, update, and delete data. 

To run the program:
1. Clone to your local
2. Run pipenv install
3. Run pipenv shell to create a python shell
4. Run lib/cli.py in your terminal
5. Follow the instructions to explore the CLI
6. Type exit, then enter to exit the program at any time
